"""Pydantic output schema for Endorsement / Mid-Term Change Processing —
mirrors PRD §7.1's Endorsement Request Record Schema closely.
``requested_items``/``issued_items``/``state_licensing_clarification_needed``
are additive beyond the literal PRD schema (needed for EP-05's item-level
reconciliation and EP-02's location-addition state check) — same allowance
every prior workflow's schema.py took. Not a ``core.common`` contract; free
to evolve.
