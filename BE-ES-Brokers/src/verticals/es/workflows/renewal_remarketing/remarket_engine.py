"""Native RR-01..RR-08 logic. None of this fits the generic 6-check rules
engine — compound orchestration/decision reasoning, Option-A precedent.

RR-01/RR-02 are NOT a port from an existing MGA Renewal Management
implementation — that workflow was never built in this codebase
(``verticals/mga/workflows/`` is empty, no Workflow_2 fixture data exists on
disk). This is fresh, native threshold-based detection informed by the
PRD's description of what MGA's RN-01..08 were meant to do, not copied code.

The central judgment call is RR-04: which of the four trigger levels a
renewal earns. It is NEVER collapsed to a binary — Scenario 03 exists
specifically to prove a real middle state (LIGHT_REMARKET_CHECK) that a
binary implementation would misclassify in either direction.
