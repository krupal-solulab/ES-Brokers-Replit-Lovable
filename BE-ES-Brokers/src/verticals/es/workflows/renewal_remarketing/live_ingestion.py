"""Additive real-ingestion path for Renewal Remarketing (FR-2): builds a
``renewal_context.json``-shaped dict from an ACTUAL Binder Issuance bind
record plus real Endorsement Processing history for that same bind, instead
of the static Workflow_16 fixture (``scenario_loader.py``, untouched by this
module) — the genuine "current, accurate account profile" hand-off FR-2
always described: "combining the original bind record... with any
subsequent endorsement history... exposure changes already reflected in an
endorsement must not be re-treated as new information at renewal."

Real data status per RR rule, as of the gap-fill pass (all confirmed
against the real schemas, not assumed):
- **RR-01 (exposure change)**: Endorsement Processing's `classify()` already
  computes a real `percent_change` for `employee_count_update` endorsements
  (previously computed and silently discarded — now plumbed through to
  `EndorsementRequestPayload.requested_change.percent_change`). When the
  most recent material (`UNDERWRITING_REVIEW_REQUIRED`) endorsement for this
  bind is that type, its real percentage drives `exposure_change.pct_change`
  here. Other material-endorsement types (e.g. `limit_increase`) have no
  comparable numeric signal, so `pct_change` honestly falls back to `0.0`
  for those — never a guessed percentage. The `already_endorsed` `note`
  (satisfying `remarket_engine.py`'s existing `_ALREADY_EXPLAINED_PATTERNS`
  regex, unchanged) still fires whenever a material endorsement exists,
  regardless of whether a numeric delta was available.
- **RR-02 (loss history)**: no claims/loss-run WORKFLOW exists in the
  bind→endorsement→renewal chain, so there is still no structured claims
  data source. What this pass closes is narrower but real: the same
  connected inbox already searched for RR-03's incumbent offer is also
  checked for a real message that actually mentions claims/loss activity
  (`_check_loss_activity_update`, below) — only ever real message text,
  never a fabricated narrative. When no such message exists (every fixture
  scenario, and most live accounts most of the time), `expiring_term_
  loss_activity` stays `""`, unchanged from before. `remarket_engine.py`'s
  existing, unmodified `detect_loss_history_change()` still does the actual
  parsing of whatever text this returns.
- **RR-03/RR-07 (incumbent offer / non-response)**: now genuinely real.
  Binder & Issuance's bind terms carry a real (explicitly assumed-default,
  12-month-term) `expiration_date` (see its `schema.py`); once that exists,
  `_check_incumbent_offer_status()` searches the connected live inbox for a
  message that actually parses as a renewal offer (a real premium). Found →
  `received=True` with a real `days_before_expiration`/`pct_premium_change`.
  Not found → `received=False` with a real `days_before_expiration_at_check`,
  letting `check_incumbent_status()`'s existing, unmodified non-response
  threshold genuinely fire `URGENT_REMARKET`.
- **RR-08 (remarketing history)**: now genuinely real — `_real_remarketing_
  history()` reads this workflow's own real prior trigger-stage reviews for
  the same named insured (a different real bind_id per real renewal cycle),
  never a hand-authored or simulated history.
- All of the above still resolve through `remarket_engine.py`'s existing,
  completely unmodified rule functions — this module only ever supplies
  better real inputs, never new decision logic.
