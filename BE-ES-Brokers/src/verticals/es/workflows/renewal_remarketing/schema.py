"""Pydantic output schema for Renewal Remarketing — mirrors PRD §7.1's
Remarket Decision Output Schema closely. A few additive fields beyond the
literal schema (``pct_change``/``note`` on exposure change,
``remarketing_history_detail`` as a string rather than the schema's
structured list — the actual fixture data is prose, not structured
records — and the comparison-stage fields for RR-06) — same allowance
every prior workflow's schema.py took. Not a ``core.common`` contract;
free to evolve.
