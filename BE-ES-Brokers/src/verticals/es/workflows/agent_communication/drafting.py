"""Native Option-A engine for Retail Agent Communication: deterministic trigger
classification, RA-TN tone/framing selection (see the companion
``TONE_FRAMING_RULES_GUIDE.md``), and the compliance-gate determination. None of
this fits the generic 6-check rules engine — it's compound routing logic, not a
data-driven check — so it lives natively here, thresholds as config, mirroring
package_assembly's ``assembly.py``.

Per PRD §8's architecture diagram, tone/framing selection is a deterministic,
rule-based routing step, NOT an LLM judgment call — the LLM (called from
service.py's ``draft()``) only turns already-decided facts + framing
instructions into prose. Subject lines are likewise generated natively here
(templated, not LLM free text) for every trigger type except
``NO_RESPONSE_FOLLOWUP``, whose subject depends on a prior draft's actual
subject line (FR-10) and is resolved by ``subject_resolver.py`` instead.
