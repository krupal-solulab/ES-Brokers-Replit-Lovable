"""Pydantic output schema for Pipeline & Carrier Performance Reporting —
mirrors PRD §7's schema closely. Deviations, all deliberate:

- ``remarketing_value[].outcome_type`` adds a third value,
  ``not_remarketed``, beyond the literal schema's
  ``savings_identified | confirmation_value`` — an account that was never
  actually shopped is genuinely neither, same "add a real third state"
  discipline used throughout this vertical (``PENDING_DETERMINATION``,
  ``unstated`` reason_scope, etc.).
- ``funnel[].count``/``pct_of_prior_stage`` are nullable — a data-gap
  stage (PR-06) has neither, by design.
- ``overall_conversion_pct`` and ``carrier_performance[].overall_hit_rate``
  are additive (not in the literal §7 schema) — both appear in this
  dataset's own expected report output, so they're included for FE
  parity; the funnel's overall figure is withheld whenever any gap
  exists (see ``reporting_engine.build_funnel``).
- No revenue-attribution field anywhere (PR-04) — explicitly out of
  scope per the PRD ("do not build this rule from assumption").

Not a ``core.common`` contract; free to evolve.
