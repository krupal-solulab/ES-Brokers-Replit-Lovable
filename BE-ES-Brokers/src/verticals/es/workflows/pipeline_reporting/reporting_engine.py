"""Native PR-01..PR-06 logic. None of this fits the generic 6-check rules
engine — aggregation/formatting/annotation reasoning (Option-A precedent,
same as every prior E&S workflow's own engine module).

PR-06 is this PRD's equivalent of every other workflow's highest-stakes
gate: this PRD's own risk register calls a single smoothed-over data gap
"the direct throughline back to the very first critique in this entire
project" (the original landing page's fabricated dashboard stats). Every
function here is written so that a missing figure renders as an explicit
gap, never an interpolated or silently-omitted one.

PR-04 (revenue attribution) has no field anywhere in this module or in
schema.py — the PRD explicitly says "do not build this rule from
assumption," and no scenario exercises it. Fully out of scope, not a
stub.
