"""Cross-workflow hook: fires Agent Communication drafts automatically from
Market Matching's, Package Assembly's, Quote Comparison's, and Binder &
Policy Issuance's own successful calls, per
``Data sets/Workflow 3/PRD_Retail_Agent_Communication_Copilot.md`` §4/§5.2.

Binder & Issuance's ``fire_binder_issuance_result`` introduces the 7th
trigger type, ``POLICY_DOCUMENTS_DELIVERED`` (per that workflow's PRD
FR-19 — a coordinated extension to this PRD, not something Binder &
Issuance's own PRD could specify unilaterally). Both
``PLACEMENT_CONFIRMATION`` and ``POLICY_DOCUMENTS_DELIVERED`` fire
automatically off Binder & Issuance's own run/resolve calls (same pattern
as Market Matching/Package Assembly, NOT Quote Comparison's
select-is-the-trigger pattern) — BI-06's gate is "only on a verified-clean
reconciliation," already computed by that workflow's own
``downstream_triggers_fired`` flags before this hook is ever called.

Quote Comparison's ``fire_quote_comparison_result`` is the one exception to
"fires right after the upstream workflow's own /run": per that workflow's
PRD (FR-20/FR-23 — "broker marks which quote(s) to present... which feeds
FR-20's downstream trigger"), the broker's own selection is the trigger, not
Quote Comparison's recommendation output by itself. So this one is called
from quote_comparison's ``/{item_id}/select/{quote_id}`` action, not its
``/run`` — see that router's docstring.

This deliberately reaches across workflow boundaries — WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE.md's
usual per-workflow-folder ownership rule bends here because this IS the
cross-workflow wiring the PRD calls for. Kept to this one file (rather than
inlined in each workflow) so that reach stays visible and contained, and
``market_matching``/``package_assembly``'s own routers gain only a single
call each — see their ``run_*`` handlers.

**No-throw boundary, always.** Every public function here swallows and logs
its own exceptions. A drafting failure must never surface to, or change the
response of, the workflow that triggered it — Market Matching/Package
Assembly's callers must see byte-identical behavior whether this hook
succeeds, fails, or (in dev, no ``TEST_DATA_ROOT``/LLM key) does either.

**Formerly a known v1 limitation, now fixed for the live path:**
``MarketMatchingPayload``/``PackageAssemblyPayload`` don't carry
``named_insured`` in their own output — so ``fire_no_market_found`` and
``fire_package_assembly_result`` re-derive it via ``_real_named_insured``
(below), which reuses ``package_assembly/live_ingestion.py``'s
``build_live_extracted_model`` to re-extract the submission's real,
already-persisted documents (no new extraction judgment). Still stays
``None`` (never fabricated), not "Submission", if no real documents exist
for that submission id — ``drafting.py``'s ``_subject_line``/``build_facts``
already treat every trigger field as optional and fall back gracefully in
that case.

**Scope decision, per the approved plan (not a mechanical default):**
Submission Acknowledgment fires **per carrier** from Package Assembly's own
run (one ack per carrier, using that carrier's own status) rather than one
draft combining every carrier on the submission — the combined version the
PRD's own Trigger 01 sample shows needs tracking "how many carriers were
selected" and waiting for all of them to be packaged, which is real new
infrastructure beyond this pass's thin-hook scope, not a mechanical
extension of it.
