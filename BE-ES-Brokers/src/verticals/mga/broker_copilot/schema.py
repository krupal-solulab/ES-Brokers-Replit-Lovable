"""Pydantic output schemas for MGA Broker Communication Copilot.

Shapes are LOCKED to the MGA-FE ``CommDraft`` type (camelCase JSON, mocks.ts). The
frozen ``core/common`` contracts are unchanged — this maps the frozen ``Decision`` (read
back off a Triage/Renewal ``OutputPackage``) onto the FE draft shape here, in the
workflow layer, same convention as ``renewal_management/schema.py``.
