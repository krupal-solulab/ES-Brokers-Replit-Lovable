"""Broker Communication Drafting Engine — classifies a CommType trigger off an existing
Submission Triage or Renewal Management ``Decision`` (read back from its persisted
``OutputPackage``), calibrates tone from the broker relationship, and assembles the
grounded facts for the shared ``LLMService``. This is the one genuinely new piece the
roadmap calls out (BC-01..BC-05 below) — everything else reuses the Extraction Core
(source decision already extracted its facts) and the Decision Core (recommendation +
missing-info the trigger is classified from).

No per-case literals: every threshold comes from ``BrokerCopilotConfig``, so new broker
relationships / comm types work with no code change.
